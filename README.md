# Loops & Adders

A collaborative programming art project.
It's essentially the [round-robin][round-robin] story game applied to programming.

[round-robin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_story

# The Rules

1. Turns are taken in the order specified below.
2. When it's your turn, create a PR with a single commit that adds xor removes code.

# Turn Order

* [@jdkaplan](https://github.com/jdkaplan)
* @carlsverre

# Dev Notes

`cargo run` should work to see the art.

If the app panics with `NoAvailableAdapter`, install Vulkan.
This is a known bad error message: https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/issues/653
